field of agriculture Agriculture plays a big role in the growth of the economy and survival of generations Agricultural sector plays a strategic role in the process of economic development of a country Increase in agricultural production and the rise in the per-capita income of the rural community, together with the industrialization and urbanization, lead to an increased demand in industrial production However, fast changing environment and other factors are hindering agricultural development in which it is necessary to increase productivity, employment, and income to the farmers especially the poor ones Thus, applying Geographical information System  GIS  in agriculture can somehow address the situation National Irrigation Administration by its vision to provide efficient, effective and sustainable irrigation services to the Filipino farmers by developing, construct, operate and maintain irrigation systems consistent with integrated water resource management principles contributing to agricultural productivity Irrigation is one of the most important inputs for an efficient and sustainable agricultural production Proper monitoring and evaluation is the key to successful management to prevent the effect of imbalance condition   In today’s high-tech world, information technology like Geographic Information System provides easy solutions for decision making where the key in collation of different information at usable format    Currently, most of the National Irrigation Systems data still has the traditional forms like paper maps or mylar maps which has limited information necessary for Operation and Maintenance Therefore, as NIA found these discrepancies between the data in records and actual area of each farmer, and in order to improve the situation, NIA through the assistance of Japan International Cooperation Agency,  JICA  has initiated the preparation of Parcellary maps through methods of Geographic Information System  GIS  and the establishment of FARMLAND Geographic Information System  In connection to this, NIA decided to continue this initiative as recommended by JICA to replicate the activities of TCP 3 and to distribute and install the system to the other National Irrigation System   PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE Nia Region 11 has 1 pilot NIS for the implementation of Farmland Geographic Information System  FGIS , CY 2020   OBJECTIVES  The primary objectives for the conduct of Project Farmland GIS are as follows   .Validate the parcellary map of NIA an provide a comprehensive report if the map is suitable for Farmland GIS System’s use Conduct geotagging field survey of the irrigation facilities of a pilot NIS together with NIA personnel Provide procedures and guidelines, establish a computer system infrastructure for Farmland GIS and develop GIS software to address the current problem in ISF collection Provide appropriate training and assistance to ensure the smooth implementation of Farmland GIS   TARGET AND GOALS  1.Validate and update existing Parcellary Map of Nia and provide the agency a comprehensive report if the Map is still appropriate for FGIS System  2.Provide updated farmers’ registry and database eliminating redundant or duplicated information  and  3.Provide procedures and guidelines, establish a system infrastructure for FGIS and develop GIS software to address the current problems in ISF Collection for farm area above eight  8  hectares cover in Republic Act 10969 also known as  “Free Irrigation Service Act”   FINANCIAL SOURCE/COST  The National Irrigation Administration thru GAA 2020 allocated the amount of one million two hundred eighty-six thousand eight hundred fifty-one and twenty-six centavos  1,286,851.26  under FGIS for the implementation of Batutu RIS  The allocation was utilized for capacity building, procurement of IT equipment  laptops, smartphones, Network Storage Area for Server use  to be used in the data validation and updating of database to the server   ISSUES ON COLLECTED DATA  a.No lot Code   b.Duplication of Lot Code  two parcels had the same value of lot codes   c.Inconsistency of parcel delineated vs actual validated in the field  d.Additional farmer beneficiaries not enlisted in the database   PROJECT OUTPUT  During the course of the implementation of eFGIS for Batutu RIS, this brings the opportunity to validate and update the master list and the parcels of the farmers under this System   The final output of this project is illustrated below showing the digitized parcels the irrigation network and structures and the validated output tabulation  Table 1 Comparison of collected data based on NIA Inventory CY 2021 and Enhanced FGIS  eFGIS  of Batutu River Irrigation System Farmland Geographical Information System   CONCLUSION  The Farmland Geographic Information System improves the quality and the standard of digital mapping especially in National Irrigation Administration In Batutu RIS, the FGIS leads a big impact especially in firming of Irrigated areas of the system Also, the listing of the farmer beneficiaries was reconciled thru actual validation conducted and updated in the database of FGIS
